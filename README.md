# Hospital-Dashboard
I’m excited to share my latest project—a Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard that analyses 19 months of data, covering records of 9,216 unique patients. 🏥

🚑 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard 🚑 🌟 Revolutionizing Emergency Room Operations with Data 🌟

💼 Client Challenge:

The client was facing difficulties in managing a large volume of ER data and wanted to reduce costs while maximizing revenue opportunities. I developed a statistical dashboard to provide clear insights and solutions tailored to their needs.

𝐃𝐀𝐒𝐇𝐁𝐎𝐀𝐑𝐃

📆 Monthly View: Provides insights into patient trends and visit patterns over time.

📊 Consolidated View: Offers a comprehensive overview of hospital performance.

🩺 Patient Details: Enables detailed analysis of individual patient records.

💡 Key Takeaways: Actionable insights for addressing operational inefficiencies and driving revenue.

🛠️ Solution Highlights: ✔️ Utilized complex DAX functions in Power BI to handle advanced calculations and dynamic filtering. ✔️ The dashboard is enhanced with Bookmarks, Date Slicers, and Interactive Arrow and Home Buttons, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly navigation experience.

🛠️ Tools Used: 💻 Power BI: For creating dynamic and interactive dashboards. 📑 SQL: For efficient data retrieval and transformation. 📈 Excel: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
